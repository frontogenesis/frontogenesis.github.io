A cold front arriving Sunday will increase winds and waves offshore, possibly leading to advisories. Closer to the coast, temperatures will be warm, reaching the low to mid-80s through Saturday, with a slight chance of rain on Friday. A sharp drop in temperatures is expected early next week following the front, bringing unseasonably cold weather.</p>
<p><strong>Texas Coastal Bend:</strong>
For the Texas Coastal Bend, expect light to moderate southeast breezes over the coastal waters through Friday, strengthening to moderate to fresh north winds on Sunday and Monday as a weak cold front moves through. There’s a small chance (15-25%) of showers and thunderstorms on Sunday. Near the coast, a gradual warming trend will continue through the weekend with dry conditions, followed by a return to more seasonal temperatures after the front passes.</p></p>

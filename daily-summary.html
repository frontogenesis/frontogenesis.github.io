<p><strong>Southwest Louisiana:</strong>
For Southwest Louisiana, expect cool and dry weather near the coast on Tuesday with clearing skies by early afternoon, though temperatures will drop to the mid-30s by Wednesday morning. Rain chances will increase Wednesday afternoon through Friday as a coastal low moves up the Texas Gulf Coast, bringing widespread precipitation to coastal waters. Marine conditions will be choppy with gusty offshore winds and seas of 3-5 feet Tuesday morning, calming briefly before strong offshore winds return Thursday near the coastal low, easing by late Friday.</p>
<p><strong>Texas Coastal Bend:</strong>
In the Texas Coastal Bend, expect changing weather conditions near the coast over the next few days. Marine conditions will feature strong northerly winds through Tuesday morning, leading to Small Craft Advisory conditions, before easing to gentler breezes by the afternoon and shifting onshore Wednesday. Another cold front Thursday morning will bring strong northeasterly winds again through Thursday night, calming into the weekend. Rain chances along the coast will be low to medium (30-60%) from Wednesday to Friday, peaking on Thursday with the front. Temperatures will range from the mid-50s to mid-60s Tuesday afternoon but will swing around normal through early next week. There’s also a concern for potential minor coastal flooding later this week due to a full moon and strong northeasterly flow.</p></p>

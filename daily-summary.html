<hr />
<p><strong>Southwest Louisiana:</strong>
For Southwest Louisiana, expect warm and humid conditions near the coast through Thursday, with high temperatures possibly reaching near-record levels around 80 degrees. Light to moderate onshore winds will persist over the coastal waters, but a cold front arriving late Saturday will bring a chance of showers and thunderstorms, followed by strong, gusty northerly winds by Sunday. There’s also a potential for sea fog during the night and morning hours, particularly in coastal lakes, bays, and nearshore Gulf waters, though its extent remains uncertain. Cooler weather will settle in early next week after the front passes.</p>
<p><strong>Texas Coastal Bend:</strong>
For the Texas Coastal Bend, expect changing marine and coastal weather conditions over the next few days. Southerly winds will be strong tonight into early Thursday morning, with a Small Craft Advisory in effect for open waters, and winds will ease to gentle or moderate through the rest of the week. A cold front arriving Saturday may bring a slight chance (15-20%) of showers near the coast, followed by strong north-northeast winds and rough seas of 6-10 feet, potentially leading to another Small Craft Advisory or near-gale force gusts offshore. Temperatures will remain well above normal through Saturday, with highs in the 70s to 80s, cooling to near normal (highs in the 70s, lows in the 40s) by Sunday into early next week.</p></p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Southwest Louisiana:</strong>
For Southwest Louisiana, expect mild and very dry weather near the coast through most of the coming week, with warm days in the mid to upper 80s and cool, fall-like evenings. Marine conditions and weather close to the coast should remain calm with no significant wind or fog concerns noted. Thereâ€™s a slight chance of rain by Friday as a weak weather system moves over the northwest Gulf, though the likelihood is low at less than 20 percent and depends on moisture returning to the area.</p>
<p><strong>Texas Coastal Bend:</strong>
For the Texas Coastal Bend, expect coastal flooding during high tides through at least Sunday night, particularly affecting barrier islands and possibly bays, with a moderate risk of rip currents continuing through the evening. Marine conditions will feature a gentle east to southeast breeze today, strengthening to a moderate breeze from Sunday night through Tuesday night, before calming by Wednesday. Near the coast, temperatures will be slightly above normal, with very slim chances of rain through the week, though a slightly higher chance (20-25%) is possible on Tuesday in southern areas.</p></p>

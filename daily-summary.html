There’s little chance of rain until Thursday, when a weak front may bring a few showers, with a better chance of rain and cooler weather by the weekend as a stronger front arrives.</p>
<p><strong>Texas Coastal Bend:</strong>
For the Texas Coastal Bend, expect gentle to moderate onshore breezes through the week, with winds possibly strengthening to fresh or strong conditions by the weekend as a cold front approaches. Seas may build to 5-7 feet with the front, potentially leading to hazardous marine conditions. Near the coast, temperatures will remain above average, warming from the upper 70s to lower 80s on Tuesday to the upper 80s and low 90s by midweek, with dry weather continuing until the weekend when there’s a slight 15-20% chance of precipitation over the waters.

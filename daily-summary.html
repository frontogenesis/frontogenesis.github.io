<h3>Southwest Louisiana:###</h3>

Marine conditions close to the coast should remain calm, with no mention of fog or strong winds (sustained over 20 knots or gusts over 25 knots) in the forecast. A slight chance of rain, less than 20 percent, may develop by Friday as a weak weather system moves over the northwest Gulf, though this depends on moisture returning to the area.

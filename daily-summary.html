<p><strong>Southwest Louisiana:</strong>
For Southwest Louisiana, expect challenging marine conditions near the coast as a cold front moves through early Monday. Strong, gusty winds with sustained speeds of 25-35 knots and gusts up to 40 knots are forecast for late Monday night through Tuesday evening over the Gulf waters, prompting a Gale Warning followed by a Small Craft Advisory. Winds will gradually ease by Tuesday as high pressure builds in. Closer to shore, including Sabine and Calcasieu Lakes, a Low Water Advisory is in effect Monday morning due to very low water levels. Temperatures will be much colder after the front, with lows in the upper 20s to lower 30s through Wednesday morning, and highs in the 50s on Monday and Tuesday. Skies will clear, and no significant precipitation is expected near the coast during this time.</p>

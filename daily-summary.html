<h2>Forecast Summary</h2><p><p><em>Updated December 24, 2025</em></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Southwest Louisiana:</strong>
For Southwest Louisiana, expect mild and humid weather near the coast through the weekend, with near-record high temperatures in the mid to upper 70s during the day and lows in the upper 50s to lower 60s at night. Marine conditions will feature a light onshore flow, increasing the risk of sea fog over near-shore waters, coastal lakes, and bays each night into the morning hours for the rest of the week. A cold front is expected late Sunday night into Monday, bringing cooler weather and a shift to stronger offshore winds in the coastal waters. No significant precipitation or strong winds are anticipated in the near term.</p>
<p><strong>Texas Coastal Bend:</strong>
For the Texas Coastal Bend, expect gentle to moderate onshore winds over the coastal waters through the end of the week. A strong cold front arriving Sunday night into Monday morning will bring stronger winds, near gale force, and rougher seas of 5-7 feet by Monday. Near the coast, warm and dry conditions are forecast through the week, but the cold front will usher in cooler temperatures below normal and a slight chance of rain (20-30%) early next week. Dense fog is also a concern near the coast each night through the weekend, potentially reducing visibility.</p></p>

<p><strong>Southwest Louisiana:</strong>
For Southwest Louisiana, especially near the coast, expect challenging marine conditions through Monday with strong offshore winds and building seas, which will begin to ease on Tuesday. Coastal lakes and bays may experience low water levels during low tide into Tuesday morning. Winds and seas will remain light from Tuesday night through Thursday, but another strong cold front on Friday will bring increased offshore winds and rougher seas. Overall, dangerously cold temperatures and wind chills in the single digits and teens are expected, particularly at night and early morning through Tuesday night, with a slight moderation midweek before another cold front arrives Friday, keeping temperatures well below normal through the weekend.</p>
<p><strong>Texas Coastal Bend:</strong>
For the Texas Coastal Bend, expect challenging marine conditions this week with a strong northerly breeze continuing through Monday afternoon, prompting Small Craft Advisory conditions that might extend into the evening if winds and seas remain high. Winds could strengthen to near gale force by the end of the week following a stronger cold front Thursday night into Friday. Near the coast, temperatures will be extremely cold early Monday and Tuesday mornings with wind chills well below freezing, though highs will range from the 40s to 60s through the week. There’s a low chance (20-40%) of showers Thursday night into Friday ahead of the cold front, with freezing conditions possible again over the weekend.</p></p>

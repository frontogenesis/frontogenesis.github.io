<p><strong>Southwest Louisiana:</strong>
For Southwest Louisiana, expect changing weather near the coast over the next few days. Marine conditions will feature light to moderate easterly winds through early Thursday, shifting to stronger offshore winds by Friday morning, which may require a Small Craft Advisory due to gusty conditions. Onshore flow returns by late Friday, with a likelihood of marine fog developing over the weekend due to calm conditions and cool shelf waters meeting warm, moist air. Close to the coast, anticipate periods of showers through Thursday with above-normal temperatures in the mid-70s, cooling to more seasonal levels by Friday after a cold front passes, before warming again into the mid-to-upper 70s starting Saturday.</p>

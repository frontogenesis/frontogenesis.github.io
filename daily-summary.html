<h2>Today's Summary</h2><p>For those near the coast in Southeast Texas, expect calm marine conditions through Monday with light onshore winds and seas of 3 feet or less. Winds will shift to east-northeast on Tuesday and Wednesday, then back to onshore by Thursday through the weekend, with water levels possibly rising to 3.0-3.5 feet above mean lower low water during high tide through mid-week. There’s no mention of fog near the coast, and wind speeds are expected to remain below significant thresholds. Overall, the weather will stay mostly dry with high temperatures in the upper 80s to lower 90s—about 5-10 degrees warmer than normal—due to a persistent high-pressure system over Mexico and Texas. Lows will be in the lower to mid-70s along the coast. Slight rain chances may develop late Thursday into Saturday as a low-pressure system moves through the region, potentially followed by a cold front over the weekend, though the exact timing and impact remain uncertain.</p>

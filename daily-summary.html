<p><strong>Southwest Louisiana:</strong>
For Southwest Louisiana, expect changing marine and coastal weather conditions this week. Showers and storms will move through the coastal waters early Sunday, improving by mid-morning to early afternoon as a front passes. Winds will be light and northerly through Tuesday. However, a stronger front Tuesday night into Wednesday will bring significantly stronger winds, with gusty conditions persisting into the latter half of the week. Near the coast, temperatures will start mild with highs in the upper 70s to low 80s on Sunday, but much cooler air arrives midweek, dropping highs to the mid to upper 60s and lows into the 40s and 50s. Isolated showers are possible Sunday before the front, with dry weather expected afterward until late Tuesday.</p>
<p><strong>Texas Coastal Bend:</strong>
For the Texas Coastal Bend, expect moderate to strong south-southeasterly winds tonight, with seas building to 5-7 feet and a Small Craft Advisory in effect until 1 AM. Thereâ€™s a 40-50% chance of showers and thunderstorms overnight, decreasing by mid-morning Sunday. Winds will ease to a gentle to moderate breeze on Sunday and stay light to moderate through mid-week, but stronger winds are expected again by Tuesday night with a cold front, potentially requiring another Small Craft Advisory or even Gale headlines. Near the coast, warm weather continues through Monday, with cooler temperatures arriving mid-week, dropping highs to the 70s and lows to the mid-40s to low 50s by Wednesday.</p></p>

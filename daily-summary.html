<p><strong>Southwest Louisiana:</strong>
For Southwest Louisiana, expect changing weather near the coast over the next few days. On Friday, onshore winds will return, becoming breezy with southwest winds, followed by strong, hazardous winds and rough seas starting Saturday morning due to a series of cold fronts moving into the northern Gulf. These offshore winds will continue through the weekend, worsening low water levels at low tide. Temperatures will be warm today in the upper 60s to 70s but will drop to the low to mid 50s over the weekend, with overnight lows in the mid 20s to lower 30s Saturday night into Sunday. Light rain showers are possible tonight into Saturday morning, though chances are low.</p>

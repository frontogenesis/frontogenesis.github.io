<p><strong>Southwest Louisiana:</strong>
For Southwest Louisiana, expect calm marine conditions along the coast this week with light onshore winds and low seas. Dense fog is likely over near-shore waters, coastal lakes, and bays each night into the morning hours, potentially reducing visibility. No significant rainfall is anticipated in the short term, but scattered showers are possible late Sunday with an approaching cold front. Temperatures will remain unseasonably warm through the end of Christmas week, with near-record highs possible, before cooler weather arrives early next week.</p>
<p><strong>Texas Coastal Bend:</strong>
For the Texas Coastal Bend, expect light to moderate southeasterly winds and seas of 2-4 feet through Friday night, with winds strengthening to moderate levels by Saturday. A cold front arriving Sunday morning will bring strong to near-gale force winds from the northeast and rougher seas of 5-7 feet by Monday morning. Near the coast, sea fog will reduce visibility through the morning hours, with a Dense Fog Advisory in effect for inland bays, nearshore waters, barrier islands, and coastal zones, though it should clear by afternoon. Temperatures will remain warm, 10-15°F above normal this week, but a significant cool-down is expected after the cold front, with highs dropping to the 60s and lows in the 40s by the last days of 2025. There’s a slight 10-20% chance of rain this afternoon and a low chance of precipitation with the cold front, though details remain uncertain.</p></p>

<p><strong>Southwest Louisiana:</strong>
For Southwest Louisiana, expect changing weather near the coast over the next few days. Marine conditions will start with light east to southeast winds today, increasing tonight into Friday as a low-pressure system develops. Elevated onshore winds will persist through Saturday night, and a Small Craft Advisory may be needed during this time. Closer to the coast, widespread rainfall is forecast from Friday afternoon through Sunday evening, with 2 to 4 inches expected and locally higher amounts possible. Temperatures will remain mild initially, but cooler air is expected by the middle of next week.</p>
<p><strong>Texas Coastal Bend:</strong>
For the Texas Coastal Bend, expect warm and muggy weather through the end of the week, with temperatures well above normal. Rain chances will increase, especially on Saturday, with a higher likelihood of showers near northern coastal areas and over the Gulf waters. Marine conditions will become hazardous late Friday into Saturday, with fresh to strong southeasterly winds and seas building to 5-7 feet, potentially requiring Small Craft Advisories for the Gulf waters. Thereâ€™s also a risk of minor coastal flooding and increased rip currents at area beaches on Saturday due to elevated tides and onshore flow. Rain may linger into Saturday night but should clear by Sunday.</p></p>

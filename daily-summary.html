<p><strong>Southwest Louisiana:</strong>
For Southwest Louisiana, expect mild and dry weather near the coast through most of the coming week, with warm days and cool evenings. Marine conditions should remain calm, with no strong winds (sustained over 20 knots or gusts over 25 knots) or fog anticipated in the forecast. Thereâ€™s a slight chance of rain by Friday as a weak weather system moves over the northwest Gulf, though this depends on moisture returning to the area. Overall, the forecast remains stable with no significant coastal or marine concerns at this time.</p>
<p><strong>Texas Coastal Bend:</strong>
For the Texas Coastal Bend, expect challenging marine conditions near the coast through at least Sunday night, with coastal flooding likely during high tides. Swell periods of 9-10 seconds and heights of 1-3 feet will contribute to elevated water levels, increasing the risk of flooding, especially south of Port Aransas. A moderate east to southeast breeze will develop Sunday night through Tuesday night, though winds are not expected to reach strong levels (sustained over 20 knots or gusts over 25 knots). No significant fog is anticipated, and rain chances remain very low (less than 10%) through the week, with a slight uptick to 15-25% late in the week. Overall, dry and slightly warmer-than-normal weather is expected near the coast, with some uncertainty regarding the duration of coastal flooding risks into next week.</p></p>

<p><strong>Southwest Louisiana:</strong>
For Southwest Louisiana, expect changing marine and coastal weather conditions over the next few days. A cold front will pass through tonight, bringing stronger offshore winds to the nearshore waters, possibly requiring a Small Craft Advisory into early Friday morning. Dense fog along lakes, bays, and nearshore areas will gradually clear by mid-morning today but may return late Friday night into Saturday and persist through next week due to warm, moist air over cool shelf waters. Temperatures near the coast will drop to the 40s overnight after the front, then moderate to the low-mid 60s on Friday, with warmer highs in the 70s returning over the weekend and lasting through Christmas. There’s a slight chance of light showers next week, but dry and mild conditions are more likely.</p>

For the Texas Coastal Bend, expect changing marine conditions and weather near the coast over the next few days.

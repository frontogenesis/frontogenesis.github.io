<p><strong>Southwest Louisiana:</strong>
For Southwest Louisiana, expect changing marine and coastal weather conditions over the next few days. Near the coast, temperatures will be warm, ranging from the mid-60s today to the mid-70s by Friday and into the weekend. Strong southwest winds are anticipated on Friday, with sustained speeds of 20-25 mph and higher gusts, potentially leading to breezy conditions. In coastal waters, variable winds today will shift to strong southwest flow by late Thursday night into Friday, prompting caution for small craft due to elevated winds and seas, with a Small Craft Advisory likely. A mostly dry front will pass through late Friday, with a slight chance of showers in waters off central Louisiana. Conditions should turn drier by Saturday with offshore winds developing.</p>
<p><strong>Texas Coastal Bend:</strong>
For the Texas Coastal Bend, expect warming temperatures through the weekend, with highs possibly reaching the mid to upper 80s near the coast on Friday, though exact coastal highs remain uncertain due to shifting breezes. Marine conditions will feature a strengthening southerly breeze Thursday night into Friday night, ahead of a cold front that will bring slightly cooler but still above-normal temperatures by Saturday night and Sunday. No precipitation is expected. Areas of sea fog, and possibly coastal fog, are likely Thursday night through Friday night, which could reduce visibility over the waters and near the shore.</p></p>

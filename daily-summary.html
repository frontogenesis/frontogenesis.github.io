<p><strong>Southwest Louisiana:</strong>
For Southwest Louisiana, expect challenging marine conditions near the coast today through Monday, with strong north winds sustained over 20-25 knots and gusts up to 35 knots, prompting a Gale Warning for coastal waters and a Small Craft Advisory for inland lakes and bays. Waves will build to 6-10 feet during this period, and a low water advisory is in effect through this afternoon due to winds pushing water offshore. Winds should ease by Monday night into Tuesday morning. Onshore flow may return by Tuesday into Wednesday. Weather-wise, a cold front will bring unseasonably cold temperatures, with highs in the upper 60s today dropping to the 30s tonight, and no significant rainfall expected in the coming days.</p>
<p><strong>Texas Coastal Bend:</strong>
For the Texas Coastal Bend, expect hazardous marine conditions from Sunday morning through Monday morning, with Gale-force winds and rough seas in the Gulf waters, where a Gale Warning is in effect, and rough conditions in the bays under a Small Craft Advisory. Winds will be strong, with sustained speeds and gusts high enough to cause concern for mariners, but conditions should improve by Monday evening. Closer to the coast, a cold front will bring cooler temperatures, with highs in the 70s on Sunday dropping to the 60s on Monday, and lows in the mid-40s along the coast by Tuesday morning. There’s a slight chance of showers or thunderstorms in the Gulf as the front passes, but no significant precipitation is expected near the coast.</p></p>

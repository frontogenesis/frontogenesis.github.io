<p><strong>Southwest Louisiana:</strong>
For Southwest Louisiana, expect mild and dry weather near the coast through most of the upcoming week, with warm days in the mid to upper 80s and cool evenings. Marine conditions close to the shore should remain calm, with no strong winds (sustained over 20 knots or gusts over 25 knots) or fog anticipated in the forecast. There’s a slight chance of rain by Friday as a weak weather system moves over the northwest Gulf, though this depends on moisture returning to the area, and uncertainty remains.</p>

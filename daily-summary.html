<p><strong>Southwest Louisiana:</strong>
For Southwest Louisiana and nearby coastal areas, expect light to moderate onshore winds through Friday, with occasional showers due to a coastal low moving across the northwestern Gulf Coast. A strong cold front will arrive late Friday or early Saturday, bringing strong offshore winds and Small Craft Advisory conditions from late Friday or early Saturday through early Monday. Light rain is also possible over the coastal waters through the weekend. Temperatures will remain mild through Friday but will turn much colder over the weekend, with showers expected today through Thursday, bringing rainfall totals of 0.20 to 0.60 inches near the coast.</p>
<p><strong>Texas Coastal Bend:</strong>
For the Texas Coastal Bend, expect changing marine and coastal weather conditions over the next few days. Along the coast, temperatures will remain above normal through Friday but will drop sharply with a strong Arctic front arriving late Friday night into Saturday morning. Showers are likely today and again over the weekend, with a slight chance of a rain or freezing rain mix Saturday night into Sunday morning. Marine conditions will worsen as strong northerly winds, reaching near gale force, develop Saturday morning and persist through the weekend into early next week, likely triggering Small Craft Advisories and possibly a Gale Watch. Coastal wind chill values will feel well below freezing from late Saturday night through Monday morning, so prepare for cold and windy conditions near the shore.</p></p>

<p><strong>Southwest Louisiana:</strong>
For Southwest Louisiana, expect changing weather near the coast over the next few days. Marine conditions will feature light onshore winds initially, with a risk of sea fog, especially at night and in the early morning through Friday. On Saturday, a low pressure system will bring breezy southerly winds with gusts near 30 mph and building seas over coastal waters, along with scattered showers and thunderstorms late Saturday into Saturday night. Temperatures will remain unseasonably warm through the period, with widespread showers expected Saturday and Saturday night, bringing average rainfall of 0.75 to 1.25 inches, and possibly up to 2-3 inches in some areas. Conditions should improve by Sunday with drier weather and breezy offshore winds.</p>
<p><strong>Texas Coastal Bend:</strong>
For the Texas Coastal Bend, expect light to moderate onshore breezes through Thursday, strengthening to moderate to fresh levels from Thursday night through Sunday as a cold front approaches and passes. This could lead to rough marine conditions with wave heights of 4-6 feet, possibly prompting a Small Craft Advisory. There’s a medium to high chance (40-80%) of showers and thunderstorms over coastal waters on Saturday due to the front. Near the coast, unseasonably warm and humid weather will persist through the week, with above-average temperatures continuing even after the front. Patchy fog is possible near the coast during overnight and early morning hours through Saturday.</p></p>
